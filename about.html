      Aluminum The Material of choice
    </h5>
    <p>
        <code> Aluminum: </code> Aluminium is a soft and lightweight metal with a dull silver-gray appearance.  Aluminium is about one-third as dense as steel or copper is 
        malleable ductile, and easily machined and cast; and has excellent corrosion resistance and durability due to the protective oxide layer. It is also 
        nonmagnetic and nonsparking and is the second most malleable metal (most being gold) and the sixth most ductile. Whether measured in terms of 
        quantity or value, the use of aluminium exceeds that of any other metal except iron and it is important in virtually all segments of the world economy. 
        Aluminium alloys form vital components of aircrafts and rockets as a result of their high strength to weight ratio. Aluminium was selected as the material 
        to be used for the apex of the Washington Monument, at a time when one ounce cost twice the daily wages of a labourer.
    </p>
  
    <p>
       
Aluminium was, when it was first discovered, extremely difficult to separate from the rocks it was part of. Since the whole of Earth's aluminium was 
bound up in the form of compounds, it was the most difficult metal on earth to get, despite the fact that it is one of the planet's most common. The reason 
is that aluminium is oxidized very rapidly and that its oxide is an extremely stable compound that, unlike rust on steel, does not flake off. The very reason 
for which aluminium is used in many applications is why it is so hard to produce.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recovery of this metal from scrap (via recycling) has become an important component of the aluminium industry. Recycling involves simply melting the 
        metal, which is far less expensive than creating it from ore. Refining aluminium requires enormous amounts of electricity; recycling it requires only 5% of 
        the energy to produce it. A common practice since the early 1900's, aluminium recycling is not new. It was, however, a low-profile activity until the late 
        1960's when the exploding popularity of aluminium beverage can finally placed recycling into the public consciousness.
